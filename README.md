# The Quantum Labyrinth

You must traverse the Quantum Labyrinth built by Erwin Schr√∂dinger, a maze governed by the laws of quantum superposition.

Every tile you can't see may revert to a superposition and collapse differently the next time you observe it.

You might be able to peek around a corner or backtrack slightly, but be wary.

#### The maze changes underfoot!
